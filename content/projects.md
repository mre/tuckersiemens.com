I **strongly** believe that the best software is open-source. You can find most
of my projects on my [GitHub profile][GitHub profile]. I tinker with some
frequently and others are just collecting dust as a way for me to measure my
growth as a programmer.

These are the projects I take some measure of pride in:

- [My dotfiles](https://github.com/reillysiemens/dotfiles): The configuration
  files that keep me from flipping a table after logging in.
- [This website](https://github.com/reillysiemens/tuckersiemens.com): You're
  lookin' at it.
- [pianodb](https://github.com/reillysiemens/pianodb): A database companion for
  [pianobar](https://6xq.net/pianobar/), a console-based Pandora client.
- [hermit](https://github.com/bike-barn/hermit): A home directory management
  tool. [@RadicalZephyr](https://github.com/RadicalZephyr) did most
  of the work.
